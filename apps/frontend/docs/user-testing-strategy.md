**Duration**: 7 days

**Testing Objectives**:
1. ✅ **Core Functionality Validation**
   - Emotion check flow completion
   - Trade logging functionality
   - Pattern recognition features
   - User onboarding experience

2. ✅ **Technical Validation**
   - Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Mobile responsiveness (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
   - Performance under typical usage
   - Error handling and recovery

3. ✅ **UX Flow Validation**
   - Navigation intuitiveness
   - Information architecture clarity
   - Feature discoverability
   - Completion rates for core workflows

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 100% of core features functional without critical bugs
- [ ] Average task completion rate >90%
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in basic audit
- [ ] Mobile experience rated 4+ out of 5
- [ ] All alpha testers can complete onboarding without assistance

### Phase 2: Beta Testing (External) - Weeks 2-4

**Objective**: Validate product-market fit and gather feedback from real day traders.

**Participant Recruitment**:
- **Target**: 10-15 active day traders

**Feedback Types**:
- **Bug Reports**: Technical issues and error conditions
- **Feature Requests**: Missing functionality or improvements
- **General Feedback**: Overall experience and suggestions
- **Ratings**: Quick satisfaction scoring (1-5 stars)

**Data Collected**:
```javascript
{
  type: 'bug' | 'feature' | 'general' | 'rating',
  rating?: number,
  message: string,
  context: {
    page: string,
    userAgent: string,
    timestamp: string,
    userId?: string,
    sessionId: string,
    userJourney: string[] // Last 20 pages visited
  }
}
```

### 2. User Interview System

- Success/failure metrics for each task

#### Feature Validation Interviews (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Validate specific features and gather improvement ideas

**Focus Areas**:
- Pattern recognition value and accuracy
- Integration needs with existing tools
- Habit formation and routine integration
