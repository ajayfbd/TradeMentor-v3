### Backend Services

#### `PatternService.cs` - Statistical Analysis Service
**Core Methods:**

1. **`CalculateTrend(List<EmotionPerformanceData> data)`**
   - Performs linear regression analysis
   - Calculates R-squared confidence values
   - Returns trend coefficient and confidence score

2. **`GenerateInsights(string userId)`**
   - Analyzes emotion-performance correlations
   - Detects statistical patterns and anomalies
   - Generates personalized recommendations

3. **`AnalyzeEmotionPerformance(List<Trade> trades)`**
   - Maps emotions to trading outcomes
   - Calculates win rates by emotion level
   - Identifies optimal performance zones

**Statistical Features:**
- Linear regression with confidence intervals
- Sample size validation (minimum 5 trades)
- Time-based pattern analysis
- Volatility detection and risk assessment
- Statistical significance testing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Statistical Analysis
- **Linear Regression**: Calculates emotion vs performance correlation with R-squared confidence
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies improving/declining emotional patterns over time
- **Confidence Scoring**: Validates insights based on sample size and statistical significance
- **Performance Zones**: Detects optimal emotion ranges for trading success

### Visualization Features
- **Interactive Charts**: SVG-based scatter plots with hover tooltips
- **Trend Lines**: Visual representation of statistical correlations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layouts that stack components vertically
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS-based transitions and keyframe animations

### Data Validation
- **Minimum Sample Size**: Requires 5+ trades for statistical reliability
- **Statistical Significance**: Only displays insights with confidence > 70%
- **Time Window Analysis**: Analyzes patterns across different time periods
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and handles statistical outliers

## 📊 Insight Types

### 1. Performance Correlation
- **Sweet Spot Detection**: Identifies optimal emotion ranges (e.g., "You win 85% when emotion = 7-8")
- **Confidence Threshold**: Minimum 75% confidence for reliability
- **Actionable Advice**: Specific recommendations for maintaining optimal state

### 2. Warning Insights
- **Danger Zone Detection**: Identifies low-performance emotion ranges
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculates probability of losses at specific emotion levels
- **Preventive Measures**: Suggests actions to avoid problematic states

### 3. Trend Analysis
- **Emotional Progression**: Tracks emotion improvements/declines over time
- **Performance Impact**: Correlates emotional trends with trading outcomes
- **Predictive Indicators**: Projects future performance based on current trends

## 🎨 Design System

### Glass Morphism Elements
- Backdrop blur effects with transparency
- Subtle border gradients
- Soft shadow implementations
- Modern, clean aesthetic

### Color Coding
- **Success/Performance**: Green gradients for positive insights
- **Warning/Risk**: Red/orange gradients for caution areas
- **Trend/Neutral**: Blue gradients for informational content
- **Confidence Bars**: Dynamic colors based on confidence levels

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Single column layout, stacked components
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Two-column grid with adapted spacing
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Full multi-column layout with large charts
