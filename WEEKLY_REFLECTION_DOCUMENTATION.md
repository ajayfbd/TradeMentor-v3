2. "When did you feel most confident in your trading decisions this week?"
3. "What market conditions triggered emotional reactions for you?"
4. "How did your pre-trade emotions compare to post-trade emotions?"

...and 15 more questions covering emotional awareness, pattern recognition, and self-regulation.

### Weekly Goals (10 Evidence-Based Options)
Research-backed goals for building trading discipline:

1. "Log emotions before and after each trade"
2. "Maintain 7+ confidence level on trading days"
3. "Journal my thoughts after any losing trade"
4. "Take a 5-minute break when emotion level drops below 4"
5. "Review my emotion patterns before each trading day"
...and 5 more goals focusing on emotional regulation and disciplined trading.

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Management
```javascript
// Local Storage Structure
{
  "weeklyReflection_2024-01-07": {
    weekStart: "2024-01-07T00:00:00.000Z",
    weekEnd: "2024-01-13T23:59:59.999Z",
    reflectionText: "This week I noticed...",
    selectedGoals: [0, 3, 7],
    question: "What emotion pattern helped you the most this week?",
    stats: {
      emotionsLogged: 28,
      tradesLogged: 15,
      averageEmotion: 6.2,
      winRate: 0.67
    },
    completedAt: "2024-01-14T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "weeklyReflectionStreak": {
    count: 4,
    lastDate: "2024-01-14T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "lastReflectionDate": "2024-01-14T10:30:00.000Z"

### Backend Integration Points
The system is designed to integrate with backend APIs:

```javascript
// Save reflection to database
await fetch('/api/weekly-reflections', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(reflectionData)
});

// Load weekly stats
const response = await fetch(`/api/weekly-stats?week=${weekStart.toISOString()}`);
const statsData = await response.json();
```

### Component Integration
```jsx
// In your main app component
import { WeeklyReflectionPrompt, useWeeklyReflectionPrompt } from './components/WeeklyReflectionPrompt';

function App() {
  const shouldPrompt = useWeeklyReflectionPrompt();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your main app */}
      
      {/* Weekly reflection prompt appears automatically on Sundays */}
      <WeeklyReflectionPrompt 
        onComplete={handleReflectionComplete}
        onDismiss={handlePromptDismiss}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
