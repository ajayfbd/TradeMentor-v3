## 🏗️ **Integrated Architecture**

### **Full-Stack Data Flow**
```
Frontend (React Query Hooks) 
    ↓ (axios + offline sync)
Enhanced API Client 
    ↓ (JWT + retry logic)
Backend Controllers 
    ↓ (service layer)
Enhanced Database Schema
    ↓ (PostgreSQL)
UserSessions + UserInsights + Enhanced Models
```

### **Offline-First Architecture**
```
User Action → React Query → API Client → Local Storage (if offline)
                     ↓                         ↓
            Cache Update ← Response ← Background Sync (when online)
```
